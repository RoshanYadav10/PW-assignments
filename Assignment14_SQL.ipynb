    "# Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "#  A database is an organized collection of data . It provides a structured way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently. Databases are widely used in various applications and industries to handle large amounts of information.\n",
    "# SQL Databases:\n",
    "# 1.SQL databases are based on the relational data model. \n",
    "# 2.They use SQL as the standard language for defining, manipulating, and querying the data. \n",
    "# 3.SQL databases enforce strict data consistency and integrity through features like ACID \n",
    "# 4.Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database\n",
    "# NOSQL Databases:\n",
    "# 1.NoSQL databases encompass a variety of data models and are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "# 2.They provide flexible schemas, allowing for dynamic changes to the data structure without requiring a predefined schema.\n",
    "# 3.NoSQL databases use different data models like key-value, document, columnar, or graph, depending on the specific database system.\n",
    "# 4.Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, Redis"
