    "# 1]Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "# Descriptive statistics involve methods for summarizing and presenting data in a meaningful and concise manner.\n",
    "#  They help to provide a clear overview of the main characteristics of a dataset. \n",
    "# Example: Imagine you have collected data on the ages of a group of people attending a conference. You calculate the mean (average) age, \n",
    "# median (middle value), and standard deviation (measure of spread) of the ages. These descriptive statistics provide insights into the typical\n",

    "# Example: A pharmaceutical company wants to determine the effectiveness of a new drug for a specific medical condition. They conduct a clinical\n",
